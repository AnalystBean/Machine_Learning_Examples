# Create a DataFrame to store the movie data
movies_df = pd.DataFrame(data['results'])

# Clean the data and remove any unnecessary columns

# Collect user data from user input

# Clean the user data and preprocess it

# Step 2: Explore and visualize the data

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Explore the movie data using various visualization techniques

# Explore the user data using various visualization techniques

# Step 3: Develop a recommendation algorithm

# Implement a recommendation algorithm using machine learning techniques

# Step 4: Build a web application

from flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for

app = Flask(__name__)

# Define routes for the web application

# Step 5: Integrate the recommendation algorithm into the web application

# Implement a function that takes user preferences as input and returns recommended movies

# Step 6: Deploy the web application

# Deploy the web application to a cloud-based platform
